SSH
=======
SSH is the act of remotely accessing a machine. SSH allows you to run commands interactively on the remote machine. 
This is done through the use of a program on the target machine, which allows the ssh client to interface with the target host.

syntax: ssh <user>@<host>
 #We'll be logged into that server.

=====================================
echo
========
command: echo Hello
 #It echos/printd Hello back.

=====================================
man
========
Most of the commands you'll learn about have a lot of options.
These options are known as flags. 

syntax: <command> <flag> <input>. 

These flags can be learned about using the man command.
 
syntax: man <command>
 #It shows what options are there for that command.
 
Note: Some commands have (--help) flag which can be used insted of man command. 
=====================================
ls
========
ls is a command that lists information about every file/directory in the directory.

syntax: ls

======================================
cat
========
cat short for concatenate, does exactly that, it outputs the contents of files to the console. 

syntax: cat <file>

======================================
touch
========
touch is a pretty simple command, it creates files.

syntax: touch <file>

=======================================
Running a binay
========
Occasionally there will be times when you want to run downloaded or user created programs. 
This is done by providing the full path to the binary or relative path

Fullpath syntax: /tmp/aa/hello.bin

Relativepath syntax: 
   to run binary in current dir : ./hello.bin
   to run binary in previous dir: ../hello.bin
   to run binary in home dir    : ~/hello.bin

Note: A binary is just executable code, think a windows exe file
