Processes
================
A process is just another word for a running program.

A list of user created processes can be viewed with the ps command.

To view a list of all system processes, you have to use the -ef flag i.e, ps -ef

Note: the 3-5 digit numbers. Those are known as Process ID's(PID's) and they're how you interact with the processes.

Note: 90% of the time you'll likely be wanting to stop these processes and that's done with the kill command.

syntax: kill <PID>

Another useful way to interact with PID's is through the command top.

top shows you what processes are taking up the most system resources, which allows you to manage the resource allocation on your system by killing unneeded processes.
